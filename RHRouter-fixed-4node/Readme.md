These examples are minimally edited from the original RadioHead RF22 RHRouter examples for a fixed-node network with one client and three servers. In this example, network connectivity, as described by the routing tables, is assumed to be 1-2-3-4. That is, only nearest neighbors can communicate with each other, so a message from 1 to 4 requires 2 hops via repeater nodes 2 and 3.

The network was tested by uncommenting #define RH_NETWORK_TEST 1 in RHRouter.h, which enforces this rule regardless of actual connectivity.

In the rf95_router_client.ino example, the client originates a message to the end server (SERVER3), which responds to the originator to acknowledge receipt. Message delivery is reliable and automatically acknowledged by intermediate nodes. However, any of the other servers may also be addressed, and they will respond with an identifying message. In this way the servers (repeaters) can be individually checked for correct operation. Servers forward messages not addressed to themselves silently.
