**Simple example of AES128 encrypted TX and RX, working with Feather M0 Lora**

This is a broadcast message with encryption key in source code, TX to RX only (no node addresses, and not bidirectional).
It demonstrate that the driver handles the block encryption properly, for an arbitrarily sized message.
