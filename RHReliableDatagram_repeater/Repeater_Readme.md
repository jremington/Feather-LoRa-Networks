This example demonstrates one approach to making a very simple two-way repeater with three nodes (two clients and one repeater), based on RH_ReliableDatagram.  Each client can transmit data message to the other client, via a line-of-sight repeater.  See the examples in directory 2node-text messages to allow text messaging via the Serial1 ports on the Feather M0 LoRa.
